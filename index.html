In 1945, every individual was preoccupied with securing daily necessities such as food and heating materials for themselves and their families. Just three days after the surrender of Wolfenbüttel, bakeries, dairy shops, and butcher stores reopened. However, gas was only available at limited times: in the morning from 6:30 to 7:00 a.m., at midday from 12:00 to 2:00 p.m., and in the evening from 6:00 to 7:00 p.m. Mayor Willy Mull urged the residents of the ducal city to donate sleeping blankets, woolen covers, shoes, clothing, and household items—not only for local citizens in need but also for liberated foreign forced laborers and former concentration camp prisoners.

The Wolfenbüttel city administration faced the enormous challenge of addressing the urgent needs of numerous displaced individuals, many of whom were deeply traumatized. These included foreign prisoners of war conscripted for the German war economy, civilians who had been forcibly deported from their homelands, and a large number of refugees. At the time, approximately 850 Displaced Persons—individuals who had no permanent ties to the city—were still housed in eleven camps throughout Wolfenbüttel. They required immediate care, and the plan was to repatriate them as soon as possible.

To tackle the most pressing tasks, local residents were mobilized. They were assigned to pick peas, collect food scraps, and retrieve ration cards for the designated distribution periods. As a precautionary measure, German soldiers released from captivity were required to surrender their uniforms between the summer and autumn of 1945. Meanwhile, the British closely monitored public sentiment among the Wolfenbüttel civilian population. Strict regulations were imposed, including a complete ban on spreading rumors about the possibility of Soviet troops occupying the British-controlled zone. </p>
